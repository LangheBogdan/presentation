Presentation Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, which showcases my skills and experience as a web developer. I've used a variety of modern web technologies to create a visually appealing and interactive site, including:

HTML5 and CSS3: I've used these fundamental technologies to structure and style my website's layout and content. I've paid close attention to detail to ensure that my website is accessible and user-friendly.
Tailwind CSS: I've used Tailwind CSS to create a consistent and modern design for my website. This framework provides me with a wide range of pre-built components and utilities, which has allowed me to create a visually appealing and functional website with minimal effort.
JavaScript: I've used JavaScript to add interactivity to my website, such as animations, form validation, and AJAX requests. I've also used JavaScript to create a responsive layout that ensures my website looks great on all devices.
GitHub Pages: I've deployed my website using GitHub Pages, which makes it easy to host and manage my site.
Key Features

About me section: I've included an "About me" section where I talk about my background, interests, and what I'm passionate about.
